            <h2>THE GAMEPLAY OF WARHAMMER 40000</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, Warhammer 40k has a complex battle round. This seems to be designed to be for the purpose of making this fictional battle be as realistic as possible. while other games limit you to a ranged <strong>or</strong> a melee attack in one turn, Games Workshop recognizes that how you move often allows you to do both. Regarding the move, there are two major opportunities to move in a single turn, not exluding reactional movement, all together making the battle more realistic and strategic.</p>
